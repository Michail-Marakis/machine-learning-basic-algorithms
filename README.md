# Machine Learning Basic Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms, developed mainly for educational purposes. **All core algorithms are implemented by me from scratch**, in order to better understand their inner workings.  
The **scikit-learn library is used only for comparison and validation**, to verify the correctness and performance of the custom implementations.

The project focuses on learning how classic machine learning methods work internally, rather than relying solely on high-level libraries.
